ONQ Educational Software
=======

	
	ONQ was my final year project our idea was to create an easy way for anybody to create a set of 
cue card’s which you could assign to a group and share with other people or create your own personal set.
	
	Once the cards are created we offered many ways to study including multiple choice questions created from 
your card set, a shooting range game where the object is to shoot the correct answer, via text where we send you questions though out the day or you can flip through your card set.
